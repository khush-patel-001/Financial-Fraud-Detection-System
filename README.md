# Financial Fraud Detection System

## Project Overview
This project is designed to detect financial fraud using advanced algorithms in machine learning. The system analyzes transaction data to identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate fraudulent activity.

## Features
- **Real-time fraud detection**: Employs machine learning models to analyze transactions in real-time.
- **User-friendly dashboard**: Visual representation of fraud detection data and statistics.
- **Data visualization**: Graphs and charts that illustrate the insights drawn from transaction data.
- **Customizable alerts**: Configure alerts based on different thresholds for suspicious activities.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khush-patel-001/Financial-Fraud-Detection-System.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Financial-Fraud-Detection-System
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset in the required format.
2. Run the main application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Monitor the dashboard for real-time fraud detection results.

## Model Information
